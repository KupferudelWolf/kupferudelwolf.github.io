Release 6.000

Weâ€™re excited to announce the long-awaited version 6 release of Charis SIL. This release is full of new features and important improvements. **Note that this is a major upgrade. This may cause document reflow as some glyphs widths have changed and some features have been removed. Please do not assume that you can replace version 5 with version 6 with no resulting changes to your publications.**

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single, all-platforms package on the [Download page](http://software.sil.org/charis/download).

#### Removed

- **Removed DSIGs added in version 5.000.** These have now been removed to reflect current best practice font development guidance. Adobe InDesign will complain that fonts cannot be found if a document last saved with version 5.000 is opened with version 5.960 or later installed. It will be necessary to find/replace the fonts in the document using the command in the Type menu. Please also look over the document carefully to note any places where changes in the fonts have affected letterforms or spacing.

- **Graphite has been removed.** Application and OS support for OpenType has greatly improved, so the need for Graphite in this font family is greatly reduced. *If this affects you, and you find that OpenType does not provide sufficient support for your needs, please contact us right away.*  

- Removed the *Show Invisibles* feature.

- Removed support for nine-level pitch contours. These will be replaced by a standalone pitch contours font in the future.

#### Known issues

- There is no support for TypeTuner or TypeTuner Web. We hope to add that support soon.

- There are no regional subsets. Please contact us if these are a priority for you and describe how you use them. We are reassessing whether to provide these subsets. With current web technology and WOFF2 compression most uses can be met equally well with the full fonts.
